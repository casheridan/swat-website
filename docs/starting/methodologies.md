# Website Methodologies

This page is about the two seperate methodologies team 1806 is using for the website.

## How this thing is built

There are two methods that are currently being worked on (as of 06/01/2022): Purity and Odyssey.

### Purity

The pure way, known as Purity, was the first and current way of developing the website. Purity only **pure** HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a hosting and database management system called Firebase. The Purity method was used as a quick and dirty way to get the website up and running with no frameworks. But the HMCJS way is very hard to develop on long term, so a new method is being developed to make development easier and faster.

### Odyssey

This new method is called Odyssey, based on the epic by Homer. Odyssey is a new way the site is being made, the tech stack is simplified and uses just the React Framework and Firebase. HTML, CSS, and Javascript don't go away but are instead packaged into a neater and faster package. With Purity you had to put Javascript into HTML, with HTML in order to create a repeating object over pages (like a navbar) you would copy and paste that code to every page in the site. But with the React Framework, it puts HTML into Javascript, allowing for faster code and easier ways of development. Like making reusable components that can be used anywhere you want. So instead of copy and pasting a navbar on everypage you just create the base navbar component and have React render the navbar as a component above all pages (see "React" page for more info). Firebase and CSS don't go away but the way that firebase is used can be a lot more effective with Odyssey.
