        <p>FIRST Stronghold &trade; is a midieval themed game played by two alliances consisting of three robots. Robots can score points by shooting "boulders" (a 10" foam ball) into a large hole in a tower, by rolling the boulder into a hole on the base of the tower, or by maneuvering over 1 of 10 defense pieces. One robot would defend their tower, while the others would do their best to take over the enemy tower. The tower would be "taken over" if 8 balls were scored into the tower (10 were required during Championships). An additional 2 ranking points would be achieved if 4 of the 5 chosen defenses were traveled over 3 times. Additional points would be earned if such obsticals were achieved during autonomous mode.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>The 2016 robot "Duke" a claw arm and a mechanim roller intake and had vision targeting that targeted the goal. It extended up to shoot the boulders in the hole of the tower.

        <h4>Game Description:</h4>
        <p>RECYCLE RUSH &trade; is a recycling-themed game played by two Alliances of three robots each. Robots score points by stacking Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling Containers, and properly disposing of pool noodles, representing Litter. In keeping with the recycling theme of the game, all game pieces used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST® at the end of the season.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>The 2015 robot was built to stack recycling bins and totes. The drive train used 2 CIM motors to power 4 omni wheels and 2 traction wheels. The intake mechanism consisted of motors on either side that drove wheels used to take in totes. To raise the totes when stacking, we used an elevator-esque mechanism to move them up and down. Pneumatic tubes ran to the arms of the lift chassis to clamp down on the totes. The body originally had the shape of a fridge, thus earning the name of "Deep Freeze". Though part of the body was taken off because of excess weight, the name stuck. A ramp was soon added to increase efficiency when collecting totes. This ramp, due to the robots name, became known as "Mini Fridge" and went under a few more name changes as it was modified. 2015 was one of the most successful years for SWAT. We came in second at the Kansas City Regional, won the Oklahoma City Reginonal, captained an alliance on the Tesla field at First World Championships, and won several off season events.</p>

The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during a two (2)-minute and 30-second match. The more Alliances score their ball in their goals, and the more they work together to do it, the more points their Alliance receives.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>Detonator, the robot for 2014, was efficiently simple and compact. Despite its small size, the robot was packed with a powerful drivetrain (8-wheel 6-CIM) and a forceful spring-loaded catapult. Its competent collector mechanism was able to gather the exersize balls reliably, hold them securely, and pass them to alliance members smoothly. Overall, Detonator was a robust and capable robot that made it all the way to the Semifinals on the Newton Division at the FIRST World Championships.</p>

        <p>ULTIMATE ASCENT™ is played by two competing alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each Alliance consists of three robots, and they compete to score as many discs into their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen (15)-second match. The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the Alliance receives. The match begins with a fifteen (15)-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. Discs scored during this period are worth additional points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by scoring as many goals as possible. The match ends with robots attempting to climb up pyramids located near the middle of the field.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>The robot for 2013 was extremely effective at throwing frisbees full court and into the goals. Our design allowed us to load frisbees directly into a circular shooter with a pneumatic wheel that threw the frisbees 54 feet across the field and into the three point goal. This robot took advantage of a mecanum type drive system, allowing for extreme maneuverability on the field. We were able to climb to the second level of the pyramid along with a four-frisbee dump for an additional 40 points.</p>

        <p>REBOUND RUMBLE™ is played by two competing Alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each Alliance consists of three robots. They compete to score as many basketballs into their hoops as they can during a 2 minute and 15 second match. The higher the hoop in which the basketball is scored, the more points the Alliance receives. The match begins with a 15-second Hybrid Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. During this Hybrid Period, one robot on each Alliance may be controlled using a Microsoft Kinect. Baskets scored during this period are worth extra points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their Alliance score by scoring as many baskets as possible. The match ends with robots attempting to balance on bridges Located at the middle of the field. In Qualification Matches, a robot from each Alliance will also try to balance on the white Coopertition™ bridge to score additional ranking points for each Alliance.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>The 2012 S.W.A.T. robot had a skid-steer drive system, with lots of traction for climbing the bridges. Three indicator lights in the shape of the FIRST® logo on the back of the robot showed drivers how many basketballs were in posession of the robot. All of this along with a hooded shooter attributed to a very well rounded robot.</p>

        <h4>Game Description:</h4>
        <p>LOGO MOTION™ is played by two competing alliances on a flat 27 x 54 foot field. Each alliance consists of three robots. They compete to hang as many inflated plastic shapes (triangles, circles, and squares) on their grids as they can during a 2 minute and 15 second match. The higher the teams hang their game pieces on their scoring grid, the more points their alliance receives. The match begins with one 15-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs and must hang Ubertubes to score extra points. For the rest of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by hanging as many logo pieces as possible. Any logo piece hung on the same peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If teams assemble the logo pieces on their scoring grids to form the FIRST® logo (triangle, circle, square, in a horizontal row in that order), the points for the entire row are doubled. The match ends with robots deploying minibots, small electro-mechanical assemblies that are independent of the host.</p>
        <h4>Description of Robot:</h4>
        <p>The 2011 S.W.A.T. robot uses an advanced drive system called crab drive allowing the robot omnidirectional movement. Crab drive uses rotating wheel modules to move forward, backward, left, left, and any angle in-between. Magnetic encoders allows on the arm allows the robot to place tubes on the rack autonomously during the first 15 seconds of the game. The main robot deploys a mini-bot to climb a 10 foot high tower to score bonus points in the last 10 seconds of the game.

        <h4>Game Description:</h4>
        <p>BREAKAWAY™ is played on a 27 x 54 foot rectangular field. The field is bordered by a set of guardrails and alliance walls. There are two "bumps" in the field that divide it into three zones. During matches, the robots are controlled from alliance stations located outside the field at both ends. These rectangular zones consist of three-team player stations that provide connectivity between the controls used by the robot operators and the arena. Goals are located at the corners of the field, and extend behind the alliance wall and adjacent to the player stations. After goals are scored, human players must pick up the balls and pass them to the center of the alliance station to be placed on a ball return rack, after which they will re-enter play at midfield. Teams are penalized if balls are not re-entered within a set time limit.</p>

        <h4>Game Description:</h4>
        <p>LUNACY™ game pieces are Orbit Balls designated as Moon Rocks, Empty Cells,or Super Cells. Two three-team robot alliances collect and score Orbit Balls in trailers attached to the opposing teams robots. Human players are positioned around the perimeter of the arena and can score from their stations. Robots are autonomous during the first 15 seconds of play, and teleoperated for the remaining 2 minutes. Trailers begin each match empty, and robots may be loaded with up to 7 Moon Rocks by their team prior to the start of the match. Human players are equipped with 20 Moon Rocks, unless the number they load into their robot, and a quantity of Empty Cells and Super Cells determined by the outcome of their previous match. If a team has not yet played a match, the human player receives 4 Empty Cells and 2 Super Cells. Moon Rocks and Empty Cells scored in an opponent's trailer, at any time and by any player, are worth 2 points. Super Cells scored in an opponent's trailer are worth 15 points. Super Cells must be "activated" before they can be played. Activation occurs when a robot delivers an Empty Cell from their Outpost to their Fueling Station. Empty Cells can be delivered throughout the match. Super Cells may only be played during the last 20 seconds of a match.</p>
